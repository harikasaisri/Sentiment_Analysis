# Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates **Sentiment Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify text (e.g., reviews, tweets, comments) into different sentiment categories such as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using techniques like **Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings**
- Model training using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation of model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results (confusion matrix, graphs, etc.)

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── Sentiment Analysis.ipynb   # Main Jupyter Notebook with code
├── README.md                  # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt           # List of dependencies
```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run **`Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`** cell by cell to see the preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## 📊 Results
- The model can classify text into **positive / negative / neutral** sentiment.
- Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix) are included in the notebook.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Use **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTMs, BERT, Transformers).
- Deploy the model using **Flask / FastAPI** as a web app.
- Create a simple **Streamlit dashboard** for live sentiment predictions.
